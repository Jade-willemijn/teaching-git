Hello,

My name is Fritz. I'm fourteen and I live in Germany. My hobbys are going to discoteques, sometimes I listen music in the radio. In the summer, I like to go swimming in a lake. I don't have any brothers or sisters. In order to go to school, I take a bus. I am in year 9 at my school. This week, on Friday is my birthday. I hope I will receive a new guitar.
When I am grown up I want to be a scientist, especially a geophysicist. That way I can connect my passion for acoustic waves of the guitar with my studies.

Yours,
Fritz Cola
