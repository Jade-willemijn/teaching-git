Hello,

My name is Fritz. I'm fourteen and I life in Germany. My hobbys are going to discos, and sometimes I hear music in the radio. In the summer, I like to go swimming in a lake. I don't have any brothers or sisters. In order to go to school, we take a bus. I am in year 9 at my school. This week, y birthday is on Friday. I hope I will receive a new guitar.
When I am grown up I want to be a scientist, especially a geophysicist.

Yours,
Fritz Cola
