Hello,

My name is Fritz. I'm fourteen, and I live in Germany. My hobbies are going to discos and listening to music on the radio. In the summer I like to swim in the lake. I do not have any brothers or sisters. I take the bus to school. I am in year 9 at my school. My birthday is on Friday of this year. I hope I will receive a new guitar.
When I am grow up I would like to be a scientist, especially a geophysicist.

Yours,
Fritz Cola
